I'm Riley Jones and these are a few things to know about me:

### my history

I've always had an interest in stats and data science and in 2019 I decided it was finally time to study it full-time. I approached this field with web development and retail experience but mostly an obsession with organizing the messiness of the real world into useful insights that can serve a broad market. In August, 2020 I officially received my endorsement from the Lambda School Data Science program. Itâ€™s been a great choice for me. So many data science and engineering concepts come easily to me and now that I've found my calling, I'm never looking back.
