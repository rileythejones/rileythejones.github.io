I'm Riley Jones and these are a few things to know about me:

### my history

I'm currently enrolled in Lamba School studying Data Science. 
I've long had an interest in data science and in 2019 I decided it was finally time to take the plunge to studying it full-time. 
I come at the field with some web programming, retail service, and retail anaylst experience but mostly an obsession with organizing the messiness of the real world into useful insights that can serve a broad market. 

### my skills

- Python, using libraries and making them. 
- SQL

- Data Cleaning 
- UX Design
- Machine Learning 

### my interests

- Statistics
- Prediction
- Fragrance
- Music 
- Nutrition

Feel free to reach out with any questions if you are interested in working with me. 

### my aspirations

- real time machine learning for interactive healthcare 
- building a fragrance design engine and starting an artisanal shop
- using machine learning to generate music
