Yelp! 

Check out my medium post and app for the details: 

- Comparing __linear regression__ against __random forest regression__ for predicting the length of a Yelp review, using Shap values to explain individual predictions of the tree.  

- Using __random forest decision tree__ to predict whether a review is from Nevada or Canada, and showing the permuation importances for the features used by the model.  

- A web app that makes predictions and demonstrates my competence with __Plotly Dash__.
