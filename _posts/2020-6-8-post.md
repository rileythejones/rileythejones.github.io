# Saltiest Hacker News Comments 
- A week long project that involved creating a NLP model to find the "saltiest" comments on the Hacker News website using
	- My contribution: applying Natural Language Processing techniques to text and populating of database of predictions to serve to the front end. 
	- Explanatory post:

	- [Repo for the project](https://github.com/best-salitest-hacker-news-trolls/machine-learning-engineers)

# Spotify Song Recommender 
- A week long project that involved deploying the DS API for an app that would recommend songs based on Spotify data. 
	- My contribution: deploying a predictive model with Flask and hosting it on Heroku 
	- Explanatory post:
[Tips for deploying a simple model with Flask on Heroku](https://medium.com/@rileymjones/tips-for-deploying-a-simple-model-with-flask-on-heroku-e2617cf71be0)
	- [Repo for the project](https://github.com/spotify-recommendation-engine-3/data_science)

# Groa - Movie Recommendations 
- A two month long project that involved deploying an existing model into a new backend infrastructure. 
	- My contribution: migrating an existing predictive model for movie recommendations to a automatically scaling AWS insfrastructure with the Cortex library 
	- Explanatory post:
[Deploying a Recommendation Engine with Cortex](https://medium.com/@rileymjones/deploying-a-recommendation-engine-with-cortex-12aa9bca8498)

- My own extension of the project where I train a BERT/Transformer model on the Groa movie review data to make sequential predictions.
	- My contribution: applying a Pytorch implementation of a transformer based model with bidirectional encodings to user watch histories to get movie recommendations.
